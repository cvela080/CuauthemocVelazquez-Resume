        <p class="lead mb-4">As a proud graduate of Oakland Charter High School, I can confidently say that my high school experience was filled with academic success, athletic achievements, and valuable work experience that has shaped me into the person I am today.

During my time at Oakland Charter High School, I was actively involved in both varsity soccer and basketball. Being a part of these teams allowed me to develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and perseverance, which have been invaluable in both my personal and professional life. Playing varsity sports also gave me the opportunity to create lifelong friendships with my teammates and coaches, who have become like family to me.
<br><br>

Throughout my high school years, I gained valuable work experience at Target and Jamba Juice. These experiences taught me the importance of hard work, responsibility, and time management. At Target, I was able to learn the value of customer service and how to effectively communicate with people from all walks of life. I honed my skills in food preparation, cleanliness, and creating a welcoming environment for customers at Jamba Juice.

These skills are transferrable to any future profession, including psychology jobs. In the field of psychology, it is essential to be able to communicate effectively with clients and colleagues. <br><br>


My experience at Target allowed me to work with diverse groups of people, which will be useful in working with a range of clients in the future. Additionally, my time at Jamba Juice taught me the importance of creating a comfortable and welcoming environment for customers which will be useful in creating a safe space for clients in a therapy session.

In psychology jobs, there is often a need to work with others as part of a team. My experience in varsity sports has taught me the importance of teamwork and leadership. These skills will be useful in working collaboratively with colleagues, and in taking a leadership role when necessary.<br><br>


Furthermore, my work experience has taught me the importance of responsibility and time management. These skills will be useful in managing client schedules, ensuring that appointments are kept on time, and in maintaining accurate and detailed records.

To conclude, the skills I learned during my time at Target and Jamba Juice are valuable for any profession, but particularly relevant in the field of psychology. The ability to communicate effectively, work collaboratively, take on leadership roles, and manage one's time effectively are all essential skills for success in psychology jobs. I look forward to utilizing these skills to better myself and my workplace in the future.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I find it to be a great stress reliever and a way to clear my mind. Additionally, I like to stay organized and productive by spending time organizing my workspace and ensuring that everything is in order. Cooking is another hobby of mine, and I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and creating healthy meals. Lastly, I believe in enjoying life and spending time with loved ones, whether it be going for a walk or trying out a new restaurant. Balance is key, and I strive to find a healthy balance between work and leisure.
